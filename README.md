Learning how to use the java.awt,geom package.


Reference website: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/geometry/primitives.html

This project is to learn how to use and implement the java.awt.geom package for
future use in the PeopleSimulator project. I hope it works, it
would kinda suck if it didn't.

Obviously you can tell that from the title that this is into more
rendering images and making shapes and such. The .geom is specifically for
points, lines, parabolic curves, bezier(cubic) curves, and rectangle-based geometric shapes
such as an arc, an elipse, a rounded rectangle, and of course a rectangle.

The plan is also to use the fill and stroke functions as well.

You should read the documentation for notes in general. I am not putting update info
and such here, sorry lol.
